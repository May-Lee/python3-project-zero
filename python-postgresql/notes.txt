Learned: dowload postgresql, install, log in and log out.
TODO: install database server, create database, do CRUD
For productivity's sake I installed psycopg2 globally.
I need to learn how to set up a virtual environment.
It would also be nice not to type python3 instead of python every time I run
a command, and get better at knowing the commands and options off the bat.
? Does a virtual environment need to be set up for every project?
Okay, you can do python3 and pip3 so there's that
pipenv shell should create environment for the current directory I think
pipenv command isn't working in venv but pip does
I'm guessing it has to do with PATH
https://python-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs.html
in pipenv python can be used but outside python3 globally
Kludgily I can test if I'm in the venv by doing python --version
import sys command doesn't work in venv (at least)
but other than that the command line is prepended with the directory I am in
Pipfile generated but does not add packages; pip freeze will show packages
Pipfile.lock not generated
pip freeze works
