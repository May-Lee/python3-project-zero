I have forgotten everything but am trying again wtih Flask.
Still so many questions.

Today's learning goal:
Think in terms of commits and branches when building your app
Understand your system more, and how to use pip/pipenv 

`pipenv shell` creates the Pipfile and starts the virtual environment 
`exit` to exit`

`pipenv install <package-name>` to install and create `pipfile.lock` which leads to deterministic 
build 

`pip install <package-name> --dev` to install as dev package 

`pipenv uninstall <package-name>` 

`pipenv check` to check for security issues

`pipenv install -r ./requirements.txt` install from a text file on same directory level 

`pipenv graph` will show dependency tree 

invoke `python` first to import 


Learned: dowload postgresql, install, log in and log out.
TODO: install database server, create database, do CRUD
For productivity's sake I installed psycopg2 globally.
I need to learn how to set up a virtual environment.
It would also be nice not to type python3 instead of python every time I run
a command, and get better at knowing the commands and options off the bat.
? Does a virtual environment need to be set up for every project?
Okay, you can do python3 and pip3 so there's that
pipenv shell should create environment for the current directory I think
pipenv command isn't working in venv but pip does
I'm guessing it has to do with PATH
https://python-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs.html
in pipenv python can be used but outside python3 globally
Kludgily I can test if I'm in the venv by doing python --version
but other than that the command line is prepended with the directory I am in
Pipfile generated but does not add packages; pip freeze will show packages
Pipfile.lock not generated
pip freeze works

To create the initial database, just import the db object from an interactive 
Python shell and run the SQLAlchemy.create_all() method to create the tables and 
database:

`from <this-application> import db`
`db.create_all()`
